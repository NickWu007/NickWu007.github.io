        <![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone! This is a brand new podcast for you!</p>

<p>In this episode, we have another great friend John joining us to talk about when you should quit a project: why you might want to consider quitting, how to deal with the guilt, what you can do to make the quitting easier, and more!</p>

<p>Breakpoints(lol):</p>

<p>00:00 Intro.
00:36 Introduce guest: John.
05:07 Speed Round with John.
16:10 Main topic: When to quit a project.
	17:21 John and Nick discuss a typical situation to quit a project.
	19:30 John explains “Sunk Cost Fallacy”, and how to weigh different options when you are at a crossroad with your project.
	24:50 Guilt of quitting a project.
	31:27 How to deal with the guilt?
	37:00 Quitting as part of time/energy management.
	42:25 “Compile down to essentials”.
45:28 Pick and Plug.</p>

<p>Bare with me with the rubbish audio, not really good with editing yet. Also if you find the audio funny from time to time, that’s probably because we had a few disconnects during recording, and some of the bits are re-rendered in post.</p>

<p>Next week we will have a new guest with a new topic! So subscribe and stay tuned!</p>
