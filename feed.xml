&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-this-came-to-be&quot;&gt;How this came to be?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit that this idea wasn’t original. I was having a conversation with my manager a few weeks ago, about how exactly I can be a more effective engineer in the team. This was one of the suggestions that he offered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You should look into your own the problem that you are solving. Collaborate with the others, but be the driving force in solving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking about my work style in the last few projects. Being a junior engineer and the newest member in the team, I was deferring to other engineers quite often, both in terms of design and implementation. Although this helped us delivering the projects in time, I don’t feel like I am actually contributing to “solving” the problem per se, but rather just solidifying ideas from other engineers. Worse still, I notice that I have grown into an awful habit: when I hit a problem that is not obvious in the first sight, my instinct is to ask someone else. In other words, I was not &lt;strong&gt;owning&lt;/strong&gt; the problem that I am supposed to solve, but rather &lt;strong&gt;dragging&lt;/strong&gt; other people into my problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why was I doing this? I reflected on my thinking when this would happen, and I realized that I was &lt;em&gt;afraid&lt;/em&gt; of owning the problem. I might not be able to come up with a solution at all, or worse, I might come up with something completely wrong and mess things up. Therefore, it is safer to seek help from someone who knows better. Although this logic isn’t technically wrong, it only solves the problem at hand in the short term, and I wouldn’t grow to be independent to take on other problems in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I realized that my way of work needed change, I consciously made sure that I ask less, and try to do more research on whatever problem that I was solving. The effect showed surprisingly quickly, only after about a week. Although it was taking slightly longer to solve individual problems, I was actually able to solve almost every problem that came to me, without asking other engineers all the time. And from the team’s perspective, the productivity has gone up, since everyone else in the team is not spending their time to answer me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/adult-cheerful-coffee.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Happy team!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another bonus that I have found that this actually extends beyond just work. When I was looking for flats to move into a couple of weeks ago, I realized that I didn’t need to consult my friends and family about every single flat, which I had been doing up to then. I listed down the criteria that I was looking for, and just made my own decision. The takeaway is this applies to literally any problem that you are facing, be it at work, in life, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-what-can-you-do&quot;&gt;So, What can you do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully my story has encouraged you to take an initiative in owning your problems. Below I list a few tips that I think will help you in getting started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;start-with-a-mental-shift&quot;&gt;Start with a mental shift&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make any tangible change, you must change the way you think first. I complete get all the concerns that you may have towards taking on a problem solo. In fact, these are the mental hurdles that I went through myself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;what-if-i-dont-know-how-to-solve-it&quot;&gt;What if I don’t know how to solve it?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I do believe that I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; the ability to solve most problems that come my way, at least at work. You are smarter than you realize, if you really stretch your mind. Have faith in yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;what-if-i-screw-up&quot;&gt;What if I screw up?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you get a wrong answer, you are not going to “screw up”. Things are not as bad as you think. Conversely, if you get it right by yourself, it would be a great confidence boost for you to take on more problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself what exactly is stopping you from owning the problem. Once you enunciate it out loud, it will be easier to analyze its validity. And most likely you are over-worrying, which is quite normal if you are new to the field or problem space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;develop-a-process-to-deal-with-the-unfamiliar&quot;&gt;Develop a process to deal with the unfamiliar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are facing a problem that involves a lot of unfamiliar places, it can be disorientating and confusing. The trick to deal with this, in my own experience, is to develop a “process” to go through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/architect-architecture-build.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Plot a process to tackle your problems&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a technical problem for example. Understanding the problem at first is crucial for me. I would do some research at first to get the context, and clarify what exactly the problem is, and which parts of the system are relevant to it. Once I nail down the general area I will dig deeper into each part, usually by reading doc and code. At this point I would know how the parts work currently, and what exactly it needs to work to solve the problem. Having this mental “diff” makes things a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I understand the problem I can think about changes to the system in order to solve it. Usually, there are many ways to solve one problem, each with pros and cons. Listing these out and comparing them will be a good way to see if there’s an optimal solution. Often times tradeoffs have to be made, and now you may need to consult someone else. Having the context, the problem definition, all the approaches with pros and cons is a good way for other engineers to quickly follow up with everything and offer suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dont-be-a-lone-wolf&quot;&gt;Don’t be a lone wolf&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having encouraged you to own the problem, I do want to point out to not be too extreme with this. There are problems that you need help with, and that’s part of the process too. At some point you might realize that you lack some crucial information, and you cannot find it easily. Then it is better to ask someone, rather than reading thousands of lines of code to draw your own insight. A balance must be held, but my point is to at least consider solving it by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;last-few-words&quot;&gt;Last few words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you start to take ownership of your problems after reading this post. I am still finding a good balance myself too, and would love to know how you feel about this.

You must been thinking I was quitting the podcast and the blog completely, especially now that I have “real job”(to be honest I did hear it from some friends). But I have been thinking about this and I feel like it is the time to come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-have-i-been&quot;&gt;Where have I been?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have been following me on Twitter, you would probably are already fairly up to date with my life. If not, here’s a quick recap. I started my new job as a full-time software engineer at Google London last September, and it has been the major focus of my life for the last few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/google_london.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Shot over King Cross Station from Google UK&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Shot over King Cross Station from Google UK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was quite challenging during the first 3 months, even with all the experience I had as an intern. We had a tight deadline for the first project, and I eventually made it by 2 days. After that I had a couple more projects to work on and now work has steadied up a bit. If you want me to discuss more about my work, either as a blog post or episode, please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, I have been continuously working on TryLinks, albeit in a smaller capacity. We were extremely to be accepted by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://2019.programming-conference.org/event/proweb-2019-papers-trylinks-an-interactive-tutorial-system-for-a-cross-tier-web-programming-language&quot;&gt;ProWeb&lt;/a&gt; conference, and I recently went to Italy to give a talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/trylinks_talk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Me giving the TryLinks talk in Italy&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Me giving the TryLinks talk in Italy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TryLinks was originally just my final project, but it has lived on much longer than I expected. Even better, it is still being worked on to add more and more features. Therefore, I am taking on a side project for TryLinks in the coming weeks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;upcoming-plans&quot;&gt;Upcoming plans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;blog&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I am taking on the TryLinks side project, it would be a perfect opportunity to do another series for the blog. I am still ironing out the detail, but the project should be kicking off around late April. In terms of the blog, I want to commit to a 2-posts-per-week schedule, so that I won’t slack off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for non-technical topics, my old backlog has been a bit dated, and I don’t think I can produce quality content on them. Also, I am thinking about moving the non-technical topics to the podcast, since it would be better to have discussions on them. Bottom line is, I am holding off non-technical blog posts for now. If you think there’s a topic you want see, feel free to let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;podcast&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfkNBxEf3tVFjCJQ67ofI2Wh5yQwPGxOn&quot;&gt;Compile Podcast&lt;/a&gt; last summer, partially because I listen to a lot of podcasts myself and really wanted to try it, and secondly it would be great as another platform for content. So far we only have a couple of episodes and I have not scheduled any new recordings. But this year I do want to keep doing it, and meet more and more people!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/podcast_setup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My recording setup&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;My recording setup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of plans, I do have still a few recordings in mind. Also, the topic backlog is still long enough for cover most of the year. One thing that I am looking for is a regular co-host. If you are interested, please let me know!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bare with me with the rubbish audio, not really good with editing yet. Also if you find the audio funny from time to time, that’s probably because we had a few disconnects during recording, and some of the bits are re-rendered in post.&lt;/p&gt;

I have been quite busy with my final year project and exams, which partially stopped my from updating the blog. The other reason is that I have felt a wane of motivation of writing, both from the extensive writing for dissertation, and the lack of material to lay out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, both the project and the exams have concluded, so I have decided to return to writing just for fun. At the moment I am still indecisive on what technical topic to discuss, but hopefully it would be settled next week. For the moment, I think it best to write something about my life, the future of this blog, and some thoughts that I have recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-next-for-me&quot;&gt;What’s next for me?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the present, I am in quite an interesting spot: not quite a student anymore, but not a professional either. Before starting my new job in September, I have blocked out a summer for myself to relax, and get ready for the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you recall in my &lt;a href=&quot;/non_technical/2018/01/08/new-year-resolutions-2018/&quot;&gt;New Year Resolutions&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned that 2018 is the year that I shall finally kick off my reading. So far I have read 2 fictions, and in the process of another non-technical book. If you have not read the Sherlock Holmes series, I strongly recommend giving it a shot. The writing is easy to follow, and the stories are a great escape from the dull daily routines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summer I plan to further my goal, and finish the book I am reading right now, and possibly read one more. In the meantime, I have also a few technical side projects to play with, and you will see them in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;random-thoughts&quot;&gt;Random thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the verge of finishing another stage of life, I have had some interesting conversations with my contemporaries, about the future and each other’s plan. I want to devote a few words on the topic. the names of individual are removed for privacy naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is extremely fortunate for me to have a job secured before my departure from uni, and the next 3 to 5 years quite planned out. However, I have witnessed so many good friends struggle to find a direction to proceed. Should we further our expertise in a grad school, make ourselves practically valuable in the industry, or seek other more fascinating opportunities in the world? The options are quite literally infinite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my head, I have always had a ultimate life goal: be a problem solver. In earlier years I took pleasure in intellectually fighting with problems, be it one form or the other. As time passes, I have grown to realize that practical problems require more than genius to solve. I must adapt to solve them, which is what I then did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is rather than trying to find one’s purpose along the way, it is better to realise the purpose within oneself, and the way should present itself. Try asking yourself: what is my purpose? What gives me the most pleasure? What motivates me? Having these fundamental questions figured out may be a better way to deciding the next steps to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, life is hard, more often than we like. You might find many obstacles, some of which are completely out of your hands. Work can sometimes be sufferingly hard, at times it seems like you are left out and alone, failures can come seemingly inevitably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be a liar if I claim that these have never happened to me, or that I don’t feel desperate, or even despair at times. There are many times that I want to give up too, and sometimes I do give up. I was fortunate enough to be able to make it through most of the times though, not only by my will, but also some help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I become quite independent, I have always had an “anchor” in my head, something that drives me to keep going. An encouraging snippet of words, a formidable rival, someone that I hold dear. The specific object has changed many times throughout the years, but the function keeps the same. They are a reminder to me, that I must not stop because of frustration, or stagnate because of boredom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that I have only found out recently is that I don’t have be alone through these hardships. In childhood, most of us were taught that seeking help can be a sign of weakness, and we grow up to hold out problems to ourselves in fear of judgement. In the last few years I have finally come to realise that everyone has their problem, and it is ok to tell someone that I am going through something hard, and I need someone to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the times the listeners are not able to give any practical help to the situation, but amazingly I have found that I can reach a solution much quicker, and less painful, with support from others. If you are experiencing hardship, I recommend to discuss it with someone you trust. It is certainly better than suffering in solitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;closing-words&quot;&gt;Closing words&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to thank again, for your continuous support for the blog. I am the one writing, but the inspiration comes from those of you who took an interest in me and the blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a nice week, and I shall see you soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nick Wu</name></author><summary type="html">I must preface this post with a sincere apology.
